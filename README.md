# PGCDS
PGCDS is a classifier generation method based on dataset complexity. PGCDS uses a series of calculations and a genetic algorithm to determine and create the pool of classifiers. The classifiers created by the method have diversity based on the classification problem's properties.
# Dependencies:
PGCDS is tested to work with Python 3.7. The dependency requirements are:
DEAP = 1.3 <br />
DESLIB = 0.3.5 <br />
Sklearn = 0.24.2 <br />
